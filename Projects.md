# My Projects

## Project 1
Stability Bounds for Correcting from Erased and Irregular Samples
-Student-Faculty Research with Dr. Sam Scholze
- Description: In this project, we implemented computational algorithms to study the stability of signal reconstruction from erased and irregular samples using frame theory. Our work focused on coding methods to compute optimal bridge vectors, solve the associated projection matrix equations, and efficiently perform signal reconstruction while minimizing error. We also conducted numerical experiments in Python/MATLAB to simulate different erasure scenarios, evaluate reconstruction performance, and visualize how varying the number of frame vectors and erasures impacts stability.


## Project 2
Application of SIRD Model and Physics Informed Neural Networks to Model COVID-19 Disease Dynamics
- Research Methods Project with Paige Keller
- Description: In this project, we implemented and compared classical SIRD models with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model COVID-19 disease dynamics. Using Python, R, and MATLAB, we coded constant-parameter and time-varying SIRD models, performed parameter estimation, and handled data preprocessing, including normalization and KNN/iterative imputation. For the PINNs, we designed and trained neural networks with custom loss functions that combined data-fitting and differential-equation-based physics constraints. We experimented with multi-output and individual compartment networks, tuning architectures, dropout, and regularization to optimize performance. Our code also automated evaluation metrics such as R^2 and MAPE, enabling systematic comparison across models. The computational workflow allowed us to visualize model predictions, assess stability, and explore the impact of preprocessing and hyperparameter choices on predictive accuracy.
